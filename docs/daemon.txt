The BSD *fingerd(8)* supports a command-line option, *-p* for specifying
a program to retrieve local system information. By default it will
use the local *finger(1)* program. This package installs a program
called *pyfingerd* to replace this. It does two things differently,

  * Information about home directories, shells and last logins is
    not revealed.
  * It supports a *~/.foaf* file which should be in N3 format which
    is served for a request for *user.foaf@host*.

To use it simply put something like::

    finger  stream  tcp     nowait/3/10 nobody /usr/libexec/fingerd fingerd -s -p /somewhere/pyfinger
    finger  stream  tcp6    nowait/3/10 nobody /usr/libexec/fingerd fingerd -s -p /somewhere/pyfinger
