pyfinger
========

This package provides some support for the finger protocol
primarily for use in the `Thimbl`_ project. It includes a
local information service for BSD *fingerd(8)*, a helper module
to teach :mod:`urllib2` about *finger://* urls and some
FOAF support.

Source code is available on `PyPI`_ as well as on `Github`_.

Installation should be as simple as doing one of the following
depending on your preferences::

  easy_install pyfinger
  pip install pyfinger
  pip install git+git://github.com/wwaites/pyfinger.git#egg=pyfinger
